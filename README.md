# CrossPlatform-Key-Logger
Here in this project, the Python key event logger is packaged as a standalone application that can run without requiring Python installed. All keyboard input is captured locally on your own machine for educational purposes, and test logs can optionally be sent to a user-specified email account for learning about automation and notifications.
